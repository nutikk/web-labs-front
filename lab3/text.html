        <h1>LET YOURSELF BE HAPPIER</h1> 
        <h3><i>than you think</i></h3>
        <h2>YOU DESERVE</h2>
        <p class="a">
        If all great things are done by a series of small things put together,
        then great lives are created by a series of small moments put together, 
        most of which we miss out on because we’re writing the synopsis rather than the paragraphs of the chapters.
        </p>

        <p class="b">
        It’s as though we live to write our eulogies. We get degrees and spouses and desire storylines and unfolding 
        fates that make sense and flow well and ultimately write beautiful and admirable stories, but only ones that we 
        will ever tell ourselves. We’re never actually remembered for more than who we were and who we loved and how we lived 
        in a moment-to-moment sense. The rest—the big, overarching, milestone kind of things don’t matter, and maybe they never did.
        </p>

        <p class="c">
        We miss the moments because we’re distracted. Distracted by the one person we search for in a crowd, fearing they’re there, 
        even when they’re hours and states and other impossibilities away. By the someone who is always on our minds when we’re writing or 
        creating or choosing or riding the train or falling asleep—and we behave as though they are with us, and narrate our lives by what 
        they’d say and feel and think if they were with us, though we know we’d never know that.
        </p>

        <p class="d">
        There’s always one daunting task, always one to-do list that fails to include anything surrounding what 
        we actually want to do. Not for work, not for the credit, not out of responsibility, but just because we want 
        to be happy. Always one more promotion, one more move, one more great love to find before we can be happy.
        </p>

        <p>
        But we aren’t. We don’t choose. We don’t think we deserve it. We keep searching, and we keep narrating, and we keep 
        living as though we have a tomorrow to live out all these grand fantasies and promises to ourselves, when the reality is 
        that unless we stop today we’ll live forever on the promise of tomorrow. These are daydreams. They’re visions and hopes and issues 
        that don’t exist. The minute you start thinking of the past or future, realize that it’s only a thought of a thing, 
        a thought that’s happening in a now. A now that we’re missing.
        </p>

        <p>
        Tomorrow never changes us. Our jobs never change us. Our relationships don’t, either. Our problems change 
        as the things in our lives do. The issues we take are reflections of what’s wrong with us, the people we hate 
        reflections of our insecurities. No matter how many things come and go, we take the same issues and hate the same people 
        for the same reasons, and never stop to realize that it’s not them that we hate; it’s the parts of us they force us to recognize.
        </p>

        <p>
        You have to stop living for how other people will remember you. Stop living by telling yourself the story that you think 
        other people will be happy reading. Because it’s an empty and lifeless one, and it robs you of the thing you’re most seeking 
        when you do it. The most important thing is that you do what makes you happy—and that you understand that your happiness is your 
        choice and your responsibility alone. It is not a day or a job or a relationship or a change away, it’s right now. The only work to 
        do is to remove the blocks that prevent you from living it out. The only change that has to happen is to you.
        </p>

        <p>
        The untold millions of little moments are what matter. It’s not about having a job; it’s about having a life that you want to live. 
        It’s not about having a degree; it’s about the nights you finally felt the opposite of loneliness. It’s not about having a relationship; 
        it’s about being in one. And it’s not about living a life that other people can sum up comfortably; it’s about having a life wherein those 
        millions of moments build and corroborate with one another—and you follow them—and have more. 
        You won’t be there to hear the stories and eulogies they tell of you—you’re only here to know them now.
        </p>

        <h1>WHY YOU</h1>
        <h3><i>shouldn’t</i></h3> 
        <h2>SEEK</h2> 
        <h2>COMFORT</h2>
        <p class="d">
        01.	Your brain can’t differentiate “good” from “bad”; it only knows “comfortable” and “uncomfortable.” This is a pretty 
        raw example, but it’s the reason why criminals never think their actions are “wrong,” they think they’re justifiable. 
        It’s why we do things we objectively know are bad for us and confuse them for “feeling good.”
        </p>

        <p>
        02.	You don’t want what you want; you want what you’ve known. We are literally incapable of predicting an outcome that is out 
        of the realm of what we’ve known previously. So rather than trying to seek “better,” we seek “the best of what we’ve known,” 
        even if “the best” is really just the solution to a problem we didn’t need to create again.
        </p>

        <p>
        03.	“Familiar discomfort” feels the same as “comfort.” Which is why so many people are stuck in “ruts” or absolutely do not 
        want to change even though they know it’s what would be best for them.
        </p>
        <p class="a">
        04.	There’s no such thing as true security. We seek comfort believing that it makes us safe, but we live in a world in which 
        there is no such thing as true security. Our bodies were made to evolve, our physical items are temporary and can be lost and 
        broken, etc. To combat this, we seek comfort rather than accepting the transitory nature of life.
        </p>
        <p>
        05.	The only way you grow is by stepping into the unknown. It’s why so many people have “breakdown before breakthrough” moments. 
        Often, their lives are leading them to better possibilities than they thought possible; they just didn’t know it was “good” 
        at the time.
        </p>
        <p class="b">
        06.	Most people don’t change until not changing is the less comfortable option. But there’s usually a long period of time 
        of increasing discomfort before “not changing” is the worst-case scenario. The universe whispers until it screams, and happy 
        people listen while the call is still quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
        07.	There are two mindsets people tend to have: explorer or settler. Our society has a “settler” mindset, our end goals are 
        “finalizing” (home, marriage, career, etc.) in a world that was made for evolution, in selves that do nothing but grow and expand 
        and change. People with “explorer” mindsets are able to actually enjoy what they have and experience it fully because they are 
        inherently unattached.
        </p>
        <p class="c">
        08.	There’s no such thing as real comfort; there’s only the idea of what’s safe. This is a big one to swallow, but there’s really 
        no such thing as “comfort,” which is why comfortable things don’t last, and why the best adjusted people are most “comfortable” 
        in “discomfort.” Comfortable is just an idea. You choose what you want to base yours on.
        </p>
        <p>
        09.	Life isn’t about being “certain,” it’s about trying anyway. Comfort is, essentially, certainty. You can either choose
        to be certain about what you’ve known or certain that you’ll make the best of whatever happens. (Guess who has a better time?) 
        Because nobody is ever really certain. The people who have lives they love try anyway.
